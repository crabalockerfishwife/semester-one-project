====================
front-end designs; base html + javascript stuff (dummy posts) (CLAIRE)
mongodb database design (FISH?)
Searching; tag system
rating system/user statistics/assigning medals
notifications (suggest homeworks, medals won, requests, deadlines) 

TIMELINE:
1. Very basic blog engine, front-end: making an account, logging in, creating a post, setting up/editing a profile; without the database stuff, just using dummy placeholders (Claire, with planning assistance from Veronika)--> Have done by Saturday night, 12/27
2. Mongodb database stuff, fitting into the model that Claire built with the front-end design (Fish)--> Have done by Tuesday night, 12/30
2. User interactions: subject vs tags, incomplete vs in progress vs complete, claiming a homework, editing a homework, getting points for homework unders specific subjects 
3. Super specifics: Suggestion system/newsfeed type thing, point algorithm/rating system, dealine system, notifications (we have to decide what notifications 
4. Contained editing system 
4. Maybe if we have time: medal system, messaging/email notifications 
5. mongodb database design 
6.
